    "Human: \nYou are a specialized time-series analysis agent. Your goal is to identify segments in a loaded time-series dataset that are similar to a given input segment and label them appropriately.\n\n**Dataset Context:**\nThe dataset has been loaded. You can use tools to interact with it.\n\n**Input Query Details:**\nThe user wants to find segments similar to the one defined by:\n- Start Row: 100\n- End Row: 150\n- Column: available_capacity (Ah)\nThe label to assign to similar segments is: Pattern_A\n\n**Task:**\nIdentify segments in the time-series data that are similar to the input segment and label them with \"Pattern_A\".\n\n**Available Tools:**\nYou have access to tools for:\n1. Loading data (`load_data`)\n2. Getting specific data segments (`get_segment`)\n3. Calculating basic statistics (`calculate_basic_stats`)\n4. Querying domain knowledge (`query_domain_knowledge`)\n\n**IMPORTANT - PLAN-AND-SOLVE APPROACH:**\nYou must use a plan-and-solve approach with these specific phases:\n\n**PHASE 1: PLANNING**\nBefore taking any action, develop a detailed plan with these components:\n\n1. **Initial Problem Analysis:**\n   - Analyze what the time-series labeling task requires\n   - Identify what information and insights you'll need\n   - Clarify any assumptions about the data\n\n2. **Task Decomposition:**\n   - Break down the labeling problem into clear sub-tasks\n   - Establish dependencies between sub-tasks\n   - Define clear success criteria for each sub-task\n\n3. **Strategy Formulation:**\n   - Select appropriate analysis techniques\n   - Decide which tools to use for each sub-task\n   - Identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies\n\n4. **Execution Plan:**\n   - Create a step-by-step sequence of actions\n   - Specify which tools will be used at each step\n   - Establish how to validate results at each step\n\n5. **Reflection on Plan:**\n   - Assess if the plan covers all requirements\n   - Identify potential weaknesses or failure points\n   - Consider alternative approaches if initial plan fails\n\n**PHASE 2: EXECUTION**\nAfter completing the planning phase, follow these steps:\n\n1. Execute your plan step by step\n2. Document your observations and findings at each step\n3. Adjust your approach based on what you learn\n4. Validate your results against your success criteria\n5. Prepare the final output with identified segments\n\n**Required Final Output Format:**\nYour final answer (inside the \"Final Answer\" action_input) MUST be a JSON object string with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"identified_segments\": [\n    {\"start_row\": <start_row_int>, \"end_row\": <end_row_int>},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"assigned_label\": \"Pattern_A\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Detailed explanation of the findings, referencing statistics, knowledge base info, and similarity criteria.\",\n  \"uncertainty_notes\": \"Notes on any uncertainties, borderline cases, or limitations.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Begin!**\n\nInput Query: Find segments similar to the one from row 100 to 150 in column 'available_capacity (Ah)', and label them as 'Pattern_A'.\nAgent Scratchpad: []"
